# Additional Materials

Here we give you links to other materials that you may want to read.
These will teach you a lot about how to work on large distributed teams
of free software developers, and about good programming style in
general.

  - [Produducing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/), by
    Karl Fogel. This is a truly excellent book of good practices that
    free software projects should follow. This is about *social aspects*
    of the project: how to treat contributors, how to organize and
    moderate communication, how to deal with non-profit foundations. If
    you ask yourself at any time, "how should I deal with
    $human\_situation in the project?", this book may provide the
    answer.

  - [GNU Coding Standards](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/). This is
    an old document, but it still has lots of excellent advice. It talks
    about C coding style, issues when dealing with plug-in systems,
    common option names for command-line programs, conventions for
    Makefiles, and some very GNU-ish details like using Texinfo for
    documentation.

  - [Linux Kernel Coding
    Style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle).
    Explains the rationale for "big indentation", brace placement,
    concise but unambiguous naming, and centralized exit of functions.
