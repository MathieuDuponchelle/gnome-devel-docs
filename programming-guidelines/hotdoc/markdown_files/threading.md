# Threading

  - Do not use threads if at all possible. ([](#when-to-use-threading))

  - If threads have to be used, use `GTask` or `GThreadPool` and isolate
    the threaded code as much as possible. ([](#using-threading))

  - Use `g_thread_join()` to avoid leaking thread resources if using
    `GThread` manually. ([](#using-threading))

  - Be careful about the `GMainContext` which code is executed in if
    using threads. Executing code in the wrong context can cause race
    conditions, or block the main loop. ([](#using-threading))

## When to Use Threading

When writing projects using GLib, the default approach should be to
**never use threads**. Instead, make proper use of the [GLib main
context](main-contexts.md) which, through the use of asynchronous
operations, allows most blocking I/O operations to continue in the
background while the main context continues to process other events.
Analysis, review and debugging of threaded code becomes very hard, very
quickly.

Threading should only be necessary when using an external library which
has blocking functions which need to be called from GLib code. If the
library provides a non-blocking alternative, or one which integrates
with a
[`poll()`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/poll.html)
loop, that should be used in preference. If the blocking function really
must be used, a thin wrapper should be written for it to convert it to
the normal [`GAsyncResult`
style](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GAsyncResult.html) of GLib
asynchronous function, running the blocking operation in a worker
thread.

## Using Threading

If `GTask` is not suitable for writing the worker thread, a more
low-level approach must be used. This should be considered very
carefully, as it is very easy to get threading code wrong in ways which
will unpredictably cause bugs at runtime, cause deadlocks, or consume
too many resources and terminate the program.

A full manual on writing threaded code is beyond the scope of this
document, but here are a number of guidelines to follow which should
reduce the potential for bugs in threading code. The overriding
principle is to reduce the amount of code and data which can be affected
by threading — for example, reducing the number of threads, the
complexity of worker thread implementation, and the amount of data
shared between threads.

  - Use
    [`GThreadPool`](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Thread-Pools.html)
    instead of manually creating
    [`GThread`s](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Threads.html)
    if possible. `GThreadPool` supports a work queue, limits on the
    number of spawned threads, and automatically joins finished threads
    so they are not leaked.

  - If it is not possible to use a `GThreadPool` (which is rarely the
    case):
    
      - Use
        [`g_thread_try_new()`](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Threads.html#g-thread-try-new)
        to spawn threads, instead of
        [`g_thread_new()`](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Threads.html#g-thread-new),
        so errors due to the system running out of threads can be
        handled gracefully rather than unconditionally aborting the
        program.
    
      - Explicitly join threads using
        [`g_thread_join()`](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Threads.html#g-thread-join)
        to avoid leaking the thread resources.

  - Use message passing to transfer data between threads, rather than
    manual locking with mutexes. `GThreadPool` explicitly supports this
    with
    [`g_thread_pool_push()`](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Thread-Pools.html#g-thread-pool-push).

  - If mutexes must be used:
    
      - Isolate threading code as much as possible, keeping mutexes
        private within classes, and tightly bound to very specific class
        members.
    
      - All mutexes should be clearly commented beside their
        declaration, indicating which other structures or variables they
        protect access to. Similarly, those variables should be
        commented saying that they should *only* be accessed with that
        mutex held.

  - Be careful about interactions between main contexts and threads. For
    example,
    [`g_timeout_add_seconds()`](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html#g-timeout-add-seconds)
    adds a timeout *to be executed in the global default main context*,
    which is being run in the main thread, *not necessarily* the current
    thread. Getting this wrong can mean that work intended for a worker
    thread accidentally ends up being executed in the main thread
    anyway. (See also: [](main-contexts.md#default-contexts).)

## Debugging

Debugging threading issues is tricky, both because they are hard to
reproduce, and because they are hard to reason about. This is one of the
big reasons for avoiding using threads in the first place.

However, if a threading issue does arise, [Valgrind’s drd and helgrind
tools are useful](tooling.md#helgrind-and-drd).
