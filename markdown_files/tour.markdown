User interface (UI) can be constructed with code or created in Glade,
the UI editor for GNOME. Glade produces XML files that describe
attributes of an application.

You will generate a GtkBuilder file in Glade and access and display a
window based on the contents of that file with a Gjs script. The script
is examined in multiple parts and included in full in the summary.
