# Create a user interface

## Get started with GNOME

Use [Glade](http://glade.gnome.org/), the UI editor for GNOME to create
a user interface. Glade produces XML files that describe attributes of
an application.

When creating a UI file using Glade, the **Name** that you specify in
Glade is the ID that you will later need to use to get the object from
the UI file.

> Create a new window, then set **Name** to
> 
>     window1
> 
> and **Window** to
> 
>     Hello World
> 
> :
> 
> ![](media/glade-set-values.png)
> 
> Save the file with **FileSave As** and name it .
