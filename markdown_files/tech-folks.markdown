# Folks

Various systems have different representations for user accounts. For
example, [Evolution Data Server]() has the user's list of email
contacts. [Telepathy]() has the user's list of instant-messaging
contacts. Various web services have the user's "friends". Libfolks takes
care of aggregating all these forms of contacts so that you can get all
the accounts that belong to one person. This lets software present lists
of people in a more useful fashion, instead of showing duplicated people
whenever they have more than one account associated to them.

In GNOME, Empathy (the instant messaging client) uses Folks to present a
unified view of people ("Person X has these IM accounts"), rather than
disparate accounts for the same person ("Person X at AIM, Person X at
GTalk, Person X at Yahoo\! Messenger").
