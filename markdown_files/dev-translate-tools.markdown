# Translation tools

## Set up translations

[]()

At this point the strings are ready for translation, or *localization*.
For projects hosted in the GNOME Git repositories, this task is handled
by the GNOME Translation Project. *Gtranslator* is a GNOME tool for
editing files. Other online and offline localization tools include
*Transifex*, *Virtaal*, *KBabel* or *Pootle*.
