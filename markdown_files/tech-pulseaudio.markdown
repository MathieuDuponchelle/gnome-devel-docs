# PulseAudio

PulseAudio is GNOME's low-level audio API. It is what sits between
applications and the kernel's audio API. PulseAudio lets you re-route
sound through the network, or to a Bluetooth headset. It can mix several
sources of audio, or change the sample rate of an audio stream.

All the parts of Gnome that produce audio use PulseAudio in one way or
another, either directly, or indirectly through higher-level sound
manipulation APIs like [GStreamer]().
