# Geoclue2

Geoclue2 provides *geolocation* services, that is, it lets applications
find the user's geographical position. A mapping application could use
this to present a "where am I" view, for example.

Geoclue2 intends to be able to provide positioning information in
several ways: from the GPS in a WWAN modem, from a Wi-Fi access point's
data, or from the computer's IP address.

Geoclue2 also intends to provide privacy for users who do not want to
reveal their geographical location. Only applications allowed by the
user will be able to get geolocation information.
