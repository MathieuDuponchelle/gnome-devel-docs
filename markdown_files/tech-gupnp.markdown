# GUPnP

Many "consumer electronics" devices that can make use of a house's local
network support device and service discovery via a protocol called UPnP
(Universal Plug and Play). GUPnP lets GNOME applications discover UPnP
devices on the network, and publish services themselves.

DLNA is a set of standards that let devices share multimedia content in
standard formats. GUPnP can also perform DLNA-related tasks such as
media profile guessing, transcoding to a given profile, etc.

In GNOME, GUPnP is one of the basic building blocks of home-multimedia
software like Rygel, a home media server.
