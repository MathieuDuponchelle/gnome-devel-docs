# License your application

When you write a new application or library, you will need to choose a
license so that others know how they can use or reuse your work.

Libraries which are used in GNOME are usually licensed under the
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/)
[LGPL 2.1+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).

Most newer GNOME applications are licensed under
[GPL3+](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), while some of the
older applications are licensed under
[GPL2+](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

User help which is written by the GNOME Documentation Team is licensed
under [CC-by-SA 3.0
Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). The
documentation team tries to use this license consistently as it allows
re-use of text from Wikipedia and many other reference sources.

Translations have the same license as the parent strings. For example,
strings from the applications are usually GPL2+ or GPL3+, while user
documentation is usually CC-by-SA 3.0.

GNOME cannot give legal advice on which license you should choose, but
you may want to read information that is available from the [Open Source
Initiative](http://opensource.org/licenses), the
[FSF](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html) and
[Dave Neary's blog post about choosing a
license](https://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2014/04/17/choosing-a-license/).
You may also find the [GStreamer licensing
information](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/licensing.html)
of interest, as GStreamer uses plugins.
