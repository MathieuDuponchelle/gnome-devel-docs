## Launch your application

[]()

Install an icon to identify your application.

When listing an icon in a desktop file, the image must be installed in a
standard location, given by the [freedesktop.org Icon
Theme](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html)
and [Icon Naming
specifications](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html).
As a minimum, an application should install a 48Ã—48 pixel icon into in
PNG format.

To match with other icons, both in GNOME and other platforms, follow the
[Tango Icon Theme
guidelines](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines)
when creating icons and application artwork.
