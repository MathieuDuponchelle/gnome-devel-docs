# GNOME Data Access

GNOME Data Access, or GDA for short, offers a wrapper around relational
databases, which allows you to easily store and retrieve data in many
different common database systems.

Instead of worrying about the vagaries of different database systems,
GDA provides a unified interface to them. GDA supports SQLite, MySQL,
PostreSQL, Microsoft Access, Berkeley DB, Oracle, and JDBC.
