# Poppler

Poppler is a specialized library to render PDF documents. This can be
used for various purposes. For example, Evince is GNOME'S PDF viewer,
and it uses Poppler for all its rendering. In addition, the software
that creates thumbnail icons for PDF files also uses Poppler. You could
even use it to create software that lets the user re-arrange or extract
pages from PDFs.
