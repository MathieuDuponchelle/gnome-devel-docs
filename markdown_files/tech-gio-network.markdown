# GIO Networking

GIO Networking is built on top of the stream APIs [used for files](). It
provides high-level APIs to communicate over TCP/IP and UNIX domain
sockets. You can use the GIO networking APIs to connect to a server,
listen for events, and read resources. The asynchronous API means your
application doesn't block waiting for a response from the network.
