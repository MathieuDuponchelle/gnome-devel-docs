# Help

Users sometimes need a little help, even with the best-designed
applications. GNOME provides a built-in topic-oriented help system that
uses the [Mallard](http://projectmallard.org/) markup language.
Pioneered by GNOME developers, Mallard is an agile and dynamic language
that helps you write and revise quickly. Its topic-oriented design means
your users can find the answers they need without sifting through a
manual. With its unique linking and organization system, Mallard is the
only language designed to handle plugin and vendor help in one coherent
document.

When you do need linear manuals, GNOME also supports the
industry-standard [DocBook](http://docbook.org/) format.
