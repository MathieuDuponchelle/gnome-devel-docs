# Files & data access

  - **Asynchronously read and write files and other streams**

  - **Store and retrieve document metadata**

Seamlessly access local and remote files using the core GNOME IO
libraries. Make your application responsive by using the extensive
support for asynchronous IO operations. Allow users to find files easily
be providing metadata to describe documents.

## What can you do?

To **asynchronously read and write files and other streams**, use
**GIO**. A high-level VFS (virtual filesystem) API is provided, as well
as utilities such as icons and application launching

Use **Tracker** to **store and retrieve document metadata**, as well as
**structured data** such as contacts.

## Real-world examples

You can see lots of real-world applications of GNOME IO technologies in
open source projects, like the examples given below.

  - **Documents** makes it easy to find your files with **Tracker**.
