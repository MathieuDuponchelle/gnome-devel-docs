# Soup

Soup, or libsoup as it is commonly called, is an HTTP library designed
to be used in graphical applications which need asynchronous operations
to avoid blocking the user interface while network requests are going
on.

Soup provides functionality for using HTTP cookies, SSL encrypted
connections, and the XML-RPC protocol based on HTTP.

> **Note**
> 
> Trivia: Soup is called "soup" because it started as a library for
> doing SOAP requests over HTTP. Spanish speakers who are learning
> English frequently confuse the words "soup" and "soap", and this
> seemed like a funny and interesting name to use.
