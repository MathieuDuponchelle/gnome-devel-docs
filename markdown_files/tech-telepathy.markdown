# Telepathy

Telepathy provides a powerful framework for interacting with the user's
instant messaging contacts. With Telepathy, all accounts and connections
are handled by a [D-Bus]() session service that's deeply integrated into
the GNOME desktop. Applications can tie into this service to communicate
with contacts.

With the Telepathy Tubes API, you can even tunnel an arbitrary protocol
over modern instant messaging protocols like Jabber to create
interactive applications. You can create multi-player games or
collaborative editors that integrate with the desktop-wide instant
messaging services.
