# GLib

GLib is the most fundamental of all the GNOME libraries. It provides
simple data structures for C programs (linked lists, binary trees, hash
tables) and various utilities such as string manipulation functions.

If you are not writing C programs, you normally don't need to be
concerned with GLib. If you are, however, GLib will make your life as a
C programmer much easier.
