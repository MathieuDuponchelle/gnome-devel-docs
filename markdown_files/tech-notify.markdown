# Notify

Libnotify provides an API for presenting notifications to the user.
Notifications can be simple messages or they can allow the user to
respond. For example, Empathy (GNOME's instant-messaging software) uses
notifications to tell the user when he gets an instant message.
Notifications made with Libnotify will use the appropriate interface in
the environment the application is running in: in GNOME 3, notifications
are displayed at the bottom of the screen and then put into the
messaging tray, while other desktop shells may choose to show them
differently.
